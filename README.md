# CSPFinal_HinesEva
I chose to do 2 intermediate options for my final which included the Youtube Video Downloader and the Steganography options. 
I chose the video downloader because I remembered doing something similar on code.org, just a few more steps and a different language this time. 
This option also gave me the opportunity to see what it was like working with and creating a GUI.
I think the process of making the GUI and lines of code translated well to the elements from past lessons and assignments like if then statements, only a few tweaking was necessary this time.
For the Youtube Video Downlaoder I ended up making a module withtin the folder I had already created that displayed the program.

I chose the steganography project for my final as well because I actually had no idea what the word even meant and wanted to challange myself to do something in an area that I was unfamiliar with. Also after learning what it meant I thought the concept was super cool and was very intriguied to try it.
Once again using statements like if, else and show, hide the code itself felt pretty familiar. 
The only module I used for this project was the programm since it wasn't as complicated as the video downloader app and a GUI was not needed in this case.
Overall I really enjoyed these projects and have had a great time in your class this year!
